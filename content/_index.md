  faqitems:
  - question: What plan should I chose?
    answer: It depends on the number of websites you manage and the number of Amazon
      affiliate links you need to check. Let’s say you are promoting 100 Amazon products
      on your website, and you want to check them every 3 days. The Personal plan
      will be just fine!
  - question: How often are my links checked?
    answer: There is no automatic scan and check of your links, as we don’t want to
      use your link quota unnecessarily. For every scan, you will just have to click
      on “New Scan” your dashboard.
  - question: What is a “link”?
    answer: In our pricing above, a “link” refers one Amazon product link. If you
      have several links to the same product multiple page, only one link will be
      deducted from your balance.
  - question: Is there any requirements to use the service?
    answer: In order to use our tool, it is imperative that you already have access
      to the official Amazon Product Advertising API. Please check in your Amazon
      Affiliate Account to ensure that you are able to create API keys before you
      buy.
  - question: What is your refund/cancellation policy?
    answer: We will accept your refund request for free for 7 days or if you haven’t
      started any scan in your account. You can also change or cancel your plan at
      any time in your dashboard.
